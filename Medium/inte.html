                Medium is not like any other platform on the internet. <mark>Our sole purpose is to help you find
                    compelling ideas, knowledge, and perspectives.</mark> We don't serve ads—we serve you, the curious
                reader who loves to learn new things. Medium is home to thousands of independent voices, and we combine
                humans and technology to find the best reading for you—and filter out the rest.
